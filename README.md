# SearchAlgorithms
A repository of programs written to illustrate the practical applications of various search algorithms and procedures, and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses.

1. The N-PUZZLE SOLVER program uses Breadth-First Tree Search to solve a 3x3 tile puzzle  (an "8-puzzle"). It serves as a demonstration of BFS. To run the N-PUZZLE SOLVER, run npuzzle/NPuzzleSolver from the build directory.

2. The ROMANIA TOUR PLANNER is another demonstration of Breadth-First Tree Search. Given a starting city (default Budapest), the program uses BFS to determine the shortest path to visit every city in Romania and return to the starting city. To run the ROMANIA TOUR PLANNER, run tour/RomaniaTour from the build directory.

3. The N-PUZZLE EFFICIENCY TEST uses A Star Tree Search and A Star Graph Search to solve an 8-puzzle, and prints out data that may be used to compare the two searchesâ€™ individual performance. To run the N-PUZZLE EFFICIENCY TEST, run npuzzle/NPuzzleEfficiencyTest from the build directory.

4. The MARS ROVER program uses A Star Tree Search to determine the optimal path of a Mars rover trying to take soil samples from as many different discrete (accessible) locations in a specified area as possible with enough energy to move 20 times, given a prespecified starting point and environment map. To run the MARS ROVER, run mars/BestPathFinder from the build directory.

This software was written by E.J. Khouri in 2015.
